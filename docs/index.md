# About PartEmitter

PartEmitter is an open-source module designed to allow the emission of particles that can physically interact with their environment on Roblox. It allows you to create Physical Particle Emitter objects that, for the most part, act just like regular ParticleEmitters. However, unlike ParticleEmitters, PartEmitters are, for example, able to detect when a particle is touched and can even be affected by the physics engine. All of these behaviours can be configured by the user to suit their need.
